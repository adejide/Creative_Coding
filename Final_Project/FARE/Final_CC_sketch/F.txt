As the MTA continues its measures to crack down on fare beating, one group is using some covert means to fight the enforcements.

Riders on any New York City subway may notice new or an increased number of signs from the transit agency, urging commuters to pay for their rides and discouraging them from jumping turnstiles and walking onto platforms using the service doors at stations.

However there is a group confronting the MTA’s efforts, putting up signs in subway cars that look exactly like the agency’s — only their message is far different.

Instead of ads reading “Together, we can make a better system” — which the agency has been posting — the guerilla ads use the exact same font and look, but read “Together, we can make a better world.” It goes on to list reasons why a person may be evading the fare, including “Maybe they don’t have $2.75. Maybe they were laid off. Maybe there’s an emergency and no time to refill. Maybe the ticket machines are broke.”
