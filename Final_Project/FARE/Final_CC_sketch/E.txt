People of color have been disproportionately arrested for fare evasion, according to NYPD data from May. Within the first three months of 2019, 87% of the 1,000 people arrested for fare evasion were either black or Latino. About 70% of the 18,700 riders issued summonses for fare beating, during that same time period, were black or Latino. 

Also uncertain of how utilizing more officers in the subway and on buses will curb fare evasion, Gelinas questioned how the MTA police will interact with the NYPD. “We (New York City) have like 2,800 NYPD Transit Police and we're going to add 500 MTA police,” Gelinas said. “What's the chain of command here? Are the MTA police going to act completely independently of NYPD? What kind of intelligence will they have? Like, the NYPD kind of knows who all your chronic pickpockets are and who are your sex offenders. There's lots of stuff beyond fare beating.”
